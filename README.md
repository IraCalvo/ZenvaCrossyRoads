# ZenvaCrossyRoads
Class game

This game  is like cross roads, where the player is meant to go from point A to point B. This game reinforced my understanding of tile palettes, movement, and collision.
I also learned how to scale the enemies's movement based on the level of the game. Additionally learned how to make the enemies and player go back to opposite sides
based on the fact if they leave the screen width given, they teleport to the other side. This is how the enemies are constantly moving in this game.
Additionally this was my first game where I learned to use SFX.
